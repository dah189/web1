			I believe that the study of HCC must involve a heart that can discover the details and develop this in a scientific and technological way. In the future, I want to use technology to enrich people's lives, instead of getting people to adapt to new technologies through a well-rounded user research and human-centered computing. As a future product leader, how to coordinate the relationship between the technology and human beings is the direction I want to pursue from now on.
